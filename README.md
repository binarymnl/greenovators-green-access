Got it ✅
Here’s a **README.md** you can drop into the root of your repo so every team member knows **exactly what to run for their part**.

# 🌱 Greenovators – Green Access Intelligence Platform

This repo contains the **MVP hackathon project** for the Greenovators team.
It is organized by module so each team member can work independently but integrate smoothly.

## 👥 Team Roles & Setup Instructions

### 🔹 Monil – Coordinator / Solution Architect

* Oversee repo structure and integration.
* Help unblock devs.
* Validate presentation and demo flow.
* Can run backend & AI locally for quick testing (`dotnet run` and `uvicorn main:app`).

---

### 🔹 Jayesh – Backend (.NET API)

📁 `backend-dotnet/`

1. Install [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

2. Run API locally:

   ```bash
   cd backend-dotnet
   dotnet run
   ```

   API will start at: `http://localhost:5000`

3. Endpoints available:

   * `POST /api/tap` → simulate tap, return eco-points.
   * `GET /api/dashboard/summary` → ESG KPIs mock.
   * `GET /api/forecast/occupancy` → mock occupancy.
   * `GET /api/recommendations` → action cards.

4. DB layer: PostgreSQL schema (tables: `Users`, `Events`, `EcoPoints`) → can mock for hackathon.

---

### 🔹 Muffeeze – AI/ML Service (FastAPI)

📁 `ai-service/`

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ai-service
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run service:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

   Runs on `http://localhost:8001`

3. Endpoints:

   * `/forecast/occupancy` → returns hourly occupancy forecast.
   * `/forecast/energy` → returns kWh forecast.
   * `/forecast/pv` → sunny vs cloudy PV outputs.

4. Goal: Later can connect with real CSV/IoT data. For hackathon, keep stub JSON working.

---

### 🔹 Janmesh – Dashboard (React)

📁 `dashboard-frontend/`

1. Install Node.js (v18+).

2. Run dashboard locally:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard-frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   Opens at: `http://localhost:3000`

3. Components to implement:

   * **SummaryTiles.js** → kWh saved, CO₂ avoided, eco-points issued.
   * **OccupancyChart.js** → show forecasted occupancy (use mock from `/forecast/occupancy`).
   * **RecommendationsPanel.js** → live recommended actions (consume `/api/recommendations`).

---

### 🔹 Shubham – Mobile App (Flutter)

📁 `mobile-app/`

1. Install Flutter SDK.

2. Run app:

   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

3. Screens:

   * **TapScreen.dart** → simulate tap & get eco-points.
   * **WalletScreen.dart** → show eco-points balance.
   * **RewardsScreen.dart** → show reward catalog.

4. Connect APIs:

   * `POST /api/tap`
   * `GET /api/users/{id}/points` (mock)

---

### 🔹 Neer – DevOps

📁 `devops/`

1. Setup `docker-compose.yml` to run:

   * Backend (.NET API)
   * AI Service (FastAPI)
   * PostgreSQL DB
2. Verify all services start with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. Ensure logging works for quick debugging.
4. Optional: Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

---

### 🔹 Shweta – QA & Demo

* Use **Postman collection** (`qa-tests/collection.json`) → import and test APIs.
* Test mobile + dashboard flows manually.
* Help prepare **demo rehearsal script**.
* Act as backup speaker during presentation.

---

### 🔹 Adarsh – Designer

📁 `designer-assets/`

* Prepare **Figma mockups** (mobile + dashboard).
* Design **presentation slides** with clear flow:

  * Problem → Personas → Solution → Demo → Value.
* Provide branding assets (logo, theme colors).
* Act as critic to polish UI/UX.

---

## 🚀 Run All Services (Local Demo)

1. Start backend (.NET):

   ```bash
   cd backend-dotnet
   dotnet run
   ```
2. Start AI service:

   ```bash
   cd ai-service
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```
3. Start dashboard:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard-frontend
   npm start
   ```
4. Start mobile app:

   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   flutter run
   ```

---

## ✅ Hackathon MVP Scope

* Live **tap simulation** → eco-points update (mobile).
* Dashboard → ESG KPIs + live recommendation card.
* AI service → returns mock forecasts (occupancy, energy, PV).
* Presentation + demo flow rehearsed.

Would you like me to also prepare a **one-page "Hackathon Quick Start Guide" (PDF)** from this README so your team can use it like a laminated cheat-sheet?
